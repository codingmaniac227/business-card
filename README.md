# ðŸªª Interactive Business Card ðŸªª
Welcome to my project! This is a fully interactive and responsive Business Card built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to showcase the power of simple yet effective design, while implementing key elements of modern web development.

## Features
- **Clean and Responsive Layout**
```
The business card uses a flexbox layout to ensure proper alignment and spacing between elements, providing a professional and clean appearance.
```
  
- **Interactive Avatar**
```
The avatar (profile image) is clickable and directs users to my GitHub profile. It incorporates:

Hover Effects: When hovered, the avatar scales up slightly, and its shadow becomes more prominent, creating a visually engaging effect.

Smooth Animations**: Transitions are applied to the hover effect for a polished and seamless user experience.
```
  
- **Color Palette**
```
A cohesive color palette inspired by modern design trends:

Background: A rich, dark tone (#040604).

Text: Soft contrasting color (#f1faee) for readability.

Accent: A striking blue (#016ec7) for borders and important text.
```

- **Typography**
```
Utilizes web-safe fonts to ensure consistency across devices:

Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma for the body.

Lucida Sans, Verdana for headings and highlights.
```

  
- **Personalization**
```
My name and role are prominently displayed, with a dynamic hierarchy of importance achieved through font weight and color styling.

Location is included for an added personal touch.
```

## Key HTML Elements Used
- **Semantic Tags:**
```
<div>: To group and style related content.

<h3>, <p>, <h4>: For structured and accessible headings and text.

<a>: To make the avatar clickable and redirect users to my GitHub.

<img>: For embedding my avatar with alt text for accessibility.
```

- **Attributes:**
```
href: For linking to my GitHub.

target="_blank": Ensures the link opens in a new tab.

alt: Provides a textual description of the image for screen readers.
```
